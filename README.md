# StackOverflowSearch
Stack Overflow is a source of helpful information for software developemnt related queries.

  While coding, all of us get entangles in one or the other type of error very often. That is where the aid sites like Stack Overflow come into picture. The general pattern of our everyday software development life involves coding and testing the code. In case we encounter errors, we search for those errors on Google, Stack Overflow, etc., fix them and continue this cycle till we get our code running the way we need.

  In this project I learnt to create a tool (Python script) that will check our Python program for errors by executing it and on encountering any errors, it will search for it on Stack Overflow and open up a few threads in web browser tabs.
