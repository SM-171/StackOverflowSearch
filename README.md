# StackOverflowSearch
Stack Overflow is a source of helpful information for software developemnt related queries.

  While coding, all of us get entangles in one or the other type of error very often. That is where the aid sites like Stack Overflow come into picture. The general pattern of our everyday software development life involves coding and testing the code. In case we encounter errors, we search for those errors on Google, Stack Overflow, etc., fix them and continue this cycle till we get our code corrected.

  In this project I learnt to create a Python script that checks a Python program for errors by executing it and on encountering any errors, searchs for it on Stack Overflow and opens up a few related threads in web browser tabs.

The following flowchart summarizes the project -
